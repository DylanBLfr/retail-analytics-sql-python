# Retail Analytics — SQL + Python

Hands-on analytics project to showcase what I learned in IBM’s **Databases and SQL for Data Science**:
relational modeling, `JOIN` / `GROUP BY`, subqueries & CTEs, a first taste of window functions,
and a clean **Python ↔ SQL** workflow with reproducible outputs (CSVs + charts).

---

## What I learned

- Translate business questions into SQL queries (KPIs, cohorts, top-N, AOV).
- Write `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, subqueries and CTEs; intro to window functions.
- Connect Python to a SQL database (SQLite), read queries with pandas, and export results.
- Produce clean charts with Matplotlib, save artefacts, and document everything for recruiters.
- Use Git/GitHub to version a small but complete data project.

## What’s inside

- **Relational schema** + **seed data** (`sql/01_schema.sql`, `sql/02_seed.sql`)
- **KPI queries** in SQL (`sql/03_kpi_queries.sql`)
- **Jupyter notebook** to run queries and generate **CSVs** + **PNG charts**
- Minimal, reproducible **project structure**
